# dm_topboard Board

This is a perfboard-like board that goes on top of a divergence meter.

The board is mostly a 3.15mm-pitch perfboard, except that it has the 
following features to accomodate parts for making it look like the
perfboard on top of the divergence meter in the anime:
- 8 holes with 16mm diameter, where pins of nixie tubes go through (to dm_nixiebrd board).
- 2 sets of 16x 2.54mm-pitch holes in the back of the board, where 16-pin DIP ICs go in.
- 1 pair of 5mm-pitch holes in the front of the board, where a coin-shaped capacitor (or anything else that looks like it) goes in.

Mounting holes are for M2.6 screws.
